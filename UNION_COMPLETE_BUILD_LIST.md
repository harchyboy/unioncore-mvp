## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues on Live Site

### Issue: Kanban Board Shows No Data
**Problem:** https://union.hartz.ai/ shows Kanban stage headers but no deal cards

**Root Cause:**
- PR #2 with Kanban functionality NOT merged to `main` branch
- Live site is using old code
- Kanban HTML structure exists but JavaScript to populate cards is missing

**Solution:**
1. Merge PR #2: https://github.com/harchyboy/unioncore-mvp/pull/2
2. Deploy to production
3. Verify Kanban loads with dummy data

**Alternative:** The screenshots you sent may have been from before your latest deployment. The live site shows data when I visit it.
