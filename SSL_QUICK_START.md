# 🔐 SSL Quick Start - Dokploy Setup

## ⚠️ Important Discovery

Your application is running on **Dokploy**, which means SSL/HTTPS should be configured through **Dokploy's dashboard**, not inside the container.

---

## 🎯 Quick Fix (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Access Dokploy Dashboard
```
Login to your Dokploy instance dashboard
```

### Step 2: Configure SSL for Your App
1. Find your **unioncore-mvp** application
2. Go to **Domains** or **Settings** section
3. Add domain: `union.hartz.ai`
4. **Toggle SSL/HTTPS ON** ✅
5. Enable "Let's Encrypt" or "Auto SSL"
6. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Wait & Test
```bash
# Wait 30-60 seconds for certificate
# Then visit:
https://union.hartz.ai

# Should show green padlock! 🔒
```

## ❓ Why the 404 Errors?

The `.well-known/acme-challenge/` 404 errors you're seeing are **NORMAL** for Dokploy:

```
Internet → Dokploy Traefik Proxy → Your Container

The SSL challenge happens at Traefik level,
NOT inside your container!
```

**What's happening:**
1. ✅ Dokploy's Traefik proxy intercepts ACME challenge requests
2. ✅ Traefik handles Let's Encrypt verification
3. ✅ Your container never sees these requests
4. ✅ This is the CORRECT behavior!

**Don't worry about:**
- ❌ Installing certbot inside container
- ❌ Configuring nginx for ACME challenges
- ❌ The 404 errors on .well-known paths

---

## ✅ Your Container is Ready!

**Current Status:**
```
✅ Vite running on port 5879
✅ Nginx running on port 80
✅ Both ports exposed
✅ Proxy headers configured
✅ Security headers enabled
✅ Ready for Dokploy SSL
```

**No changes needed inside the container!**

## 🏗️ How Dokploy SSL Works

```
[Internet]
    ↓
[Dokploy Traefik] ← SSL termination happens here!
    │
    ├─ Manages Let's Encrypt certificates
    ├─ Handles HTTPS (port 443)
    ├─ Auto-renews every 90 days
    └─ Forwards to your container (HTTP)
         ↓
[Your Container: Port 80 or 5879]
    ↓
[Nginx → Vite]
```

**Key Point:** Your container only needs HTTP. Traefik handles HTTPS!

## 📋 Dokploy Dashboard Setup

### Look for these settings:

```yaml
Domain Settings:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Domain: union.hartz.ai          │
  │ Port:   80  (or 5879)           │
  │ SSL:    ☑ Enabled               │
  │ Auto:   ☑ Let's Encrypt         │
  │ Force:  ☑ Redirect HTTP→HTTPS   │
  └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Common locations in Dokploy UI:
- "Domains" tab
- "Network" settings
- "SSL/TLS" section
- "Routing" configuration

---

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

### After enabling SSL in Dokploy:

```bash
# Test HTTPS
curl -I https://union.hartz.ai
# Expected: HTTP/2 200

# Check certificate
echo | openssl s_client -connect union.hartz.ai:443 2>/dev/null | grep "Issuer"
# Expected: Issuer: Let's Encrypt

# Browser test
# Visit: https://union.hartz.ai
# Look for: 🔒 Green padlock
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### SSL not working after enabling in Dokploy?

**Check these:**

1. **DNS pointing to Dokploy server?**
   ```bash
   dig union.hartz.ai +short
   # Should return: 65.21.77.45 (your server IP)
   ```

2. **Wait 5-10 minutes**
   - DNS propagation takes time
   - Certificate issuance needs ~60 seconds

3. **Check Dokploy logs**
   ```bash
   # On Dokploy host
   docker logs dokploy
   docker logs traefik
   ```

4. **Port 80 accessible?**
   ```bash
   curl -I http://union.hartz.ai
   # Should return 200 or 301 redirect
   ```

5. **Check Traefik dashboard**
   - Look for your application router
   - Verify SSL certificate status
