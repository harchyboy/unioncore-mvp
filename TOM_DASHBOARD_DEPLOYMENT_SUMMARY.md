## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Current Implementation
- **Framework:** React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Icons:** Lucide Icons
- **Routing:** Wouter
- **Build Tool:** Vite 7.1.9

### Routes Available
- `/` - Tom's Dashboard (default)
- `/tom` - Tom's Dashboard (direct link)
- `/home` - Original example page

### Data Source
Currently using **dummy data** to demonstrate functionality:
- Portfolio: 42 properties with realistic metrics
- Leads: 3 recent leads with BANT scores
- Brokers: 3 top performers with stats
- Pipeline: 5 stages with conversion rates

---

## 🔄 Backend Integration (Next Phase)

### APIs Needed
When you're ready to connect real data:

```typescript
GET /api/dashboard/tom/portfolio
// Returns: properties, occupancy, revenue, alerts

GET /api/dashboard/tom/leads
// Returns: pipeline stages, recent activity, sources

GET /api/dashboard/tom/brokers
// Returns: network stats, performers, commissions

POST /api/leads
// For quick lead creation

PUT /api/properties/:id/status
// For property updates
```

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket connection for live notifications
- Auto-refresh data every 30 seconds
- Push notifications for urgent items

---

## 📱 User Selection (Future)

To make the dashboard show when Tom's user is selected, you'll need to:

### 1. Add Authentication
```typescript
// Check if user is logged in
const user = useAuth();

// Redirect to login if not authenticated
if (!user) return <Navigate to="/login" />;
```

### 2. Add Role-Based Routing
```typescript
// Route to correct dashboard based on user role
switch(user.role) {
  case 'tom':
    return <TomDashboard />;
  case 'max':
    return <MaxDashboard />;
  case 'dani':
    return <DaniDashboard />;
  default:
    return <NotFound />;
}
```

### 3. Add User Selector (Dev Mode)
For testing without full auth:
```typescript
<Select onValueChange={(role) => setMockUser(role)}>
  <SelectItem value="tom">Tom (Portfolio & Marketing)</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="max">Max (Negotiations)</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="dani">Dani (Operations)</SelectItem>
</Select>
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

Currently, these features are **UI only** (not yet functional):

❌ Search functionality (visual only)  
❌ Filter operations  
❌ Form submissions (Add Lead, Update Property, etc.)  
❌ Real-time notifications  
❌ Data refresh  
❌ User authentication  
❌ Role-based routing  

**Why?** These require backend APIs which are not yet built.

**What works?** All visual elements, layout, interactions, and UI components are fully functional and ready for data integration.

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Showing After Merge?

**Check 1: Deployment Status**
- Go to your deployment platform (Dokploy/Vercel/etc.)
- Verify the build succeeded
- Check deployment logs for errors

**Check 2: Cache**
- Clear your browser cache
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Try incognito/private mode

**Check 3: Route**
- Verify you're on the root route: `https://union.hartz.ai/`
- Not `/home` or other routes

**Check 4: Build Logs**
```bash
# If self-deploying, check:
npm run build
# Should succeed with no errors
```

### Still Showing Old Dashboard?

The old home page might still be cached. Try:
1. Merge the PR
2. Wait for auto-deployment (5-10 minutes)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Navigate to union.hartz.ai

Or manually deploy:
```bash
git pull origin main
npm install
npm run build
# Restart your server/deployment
```
