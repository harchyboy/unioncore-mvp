# Property Index Bug - Final Diagnosis

## Issue
Property Index page shows "Showing 0 of 0 properties" when users search or apply filters, causing all properties to disappear.

## Critical Finding: Live Site Testing

### ‚úÖ Initial Page Load - WORKS
- Live site (https://union.hartz.ai/#/property-index) displays all 10 properties correctly
- Properties show in grid view with images, details, occupancy bars
- All UI elements (search, filters, sort) are visible

### üî¥ Search Functionality - BROKEN  
- Typing "Canary" in search box causes ALL properties to disappear
- Page shows "Showing 0 of 0 properties"
- No properties visible after search
- **This confirms the reported bug exists on production**

### üîç Local Testing Environment
- Local HTTP server (python3.11 -m http.server) shows "Showing 0 of 0 properties" even on initial load
- Properties don't render at all locally
- This suggests the production site uses a build process (likely Vite/bundler) that processes the JavaScript

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is in how the search/filter functionality works:

1. **Static HTML Properties**: The index.html contains 10 hardcoded property cards (lines 4180+)
2. **JavaScript Search**: When user searches, JavaScript tries to filter and re-render properties
3. **Rendering Failure**: The re-rendering logic fails, leaving the properties-grid div empty
4. **Property Count**: Shows "0 of 0" because the filtered array is empty or not being counted correctly

## Next Steps

1. Examine the search/filter event listeners in index.html
2. Check the `filterProperties()` and `updatePropertyDisplay()` functions  
3. Fix the rendering logic to properly display filtered properties
4. Ensure property count updates correctly
5. Test locally (if possible) and deploy to production
