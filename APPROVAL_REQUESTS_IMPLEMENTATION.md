### 4. **Data Fields Per Approval**
Each approval includes:

- **Status**: overdue, due_today, due_soon, pending
- **Days Overdue**: For overdue items (0-3 days)
- **SLA Progress**: Visual progress bar (0-100%)
- **SLA Status**: Breached, At Risk, On Track

### 5. **Page Sections Populated**

#### A. **Overview Metrics Dashboard**
Five key metrics cards showing:
- **Total Pending**: 17 approvals
- **Overdue**: 3 (marked URGENT)
- **Due Today**: 5 (marked PRIORITY)  
- **This Week**: 9 (marked UPCOMING)
- **Avg Response Time**: 2.3 days

#### B. **Critical Approvals Section**
Highlights the top 5 most urgent approvals with:
- Color-coded cards (red for overdue, orange for critical)
- Visual urgency indicators
- Quick action buttons (View Details, Approve/Escalate)
- Approver information

#### C. **All Approvals Table**
Comprehensive sortable table with columns:
- Checkbox for bulk selection
- Priority badge with icon
- Approval type with icon
- Deal/Document information
- Role badge
- Approver with avatar
- Deal value

### 7. **Technical Features**
- **Auto-detection**: Script detects when page becomes visible
- **Hash navigation support**: Responds to `#/approval-requests` URL changes
- **MutationObserver**: Watches for page visibility changes
- **Lazy initialization**: Waits for DOM to be ready
- **Error handling**: Retries if elements not found

## How It Works

1. **Page Load**: Script loads with the main application
2. **Detection**: MutationObserver watches for the approval-requests-page element
3. **Visibility Check**: Waits for page to become visible (class 'hidden' removed)
4. **Data Population**: Populates all sections with dummy data
5. **Hash Change**: Re-initializes if user navigates via hash
