- **After approval:** Build real application with backend APIs
- **Dummy data:** All data is placeholder for demonstration

## üìû Questions for Client

Before building more sections, confirm:

1. **Priority sections** - Which sections matter most for your demo?
2. **Dummy data realism** - How detailed should property/deal data be?
3. **User personas** - Show all roles or focus on specific users?
4. **Interaction level** - How much interactivity needed? (filters, search, etc.)
5. **Timeline** - When do you need the demo ready?
