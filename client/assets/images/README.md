## Primary User Avatar
The primary user avatar should be placed here as `user-avatar.jpg`

To update the user avatar:
1. Place your image file in this directory as `user-avatar.jpg`
2. The system will automatically use this image for the logged-in user

Current setup uses: Professional business portrait with brick background
